# ThisIsMyFirst
I have no clue.  I am just trying to learn what's going on without getting in the way/slowing shit down/or messing anything up.  Just observing and learning...

I have so many questions.  I chose the MIT license because in reality, I tend to get along with the majority of people I meet.  So, a license that allows people to 
work together just seems like the right choice.  I'll update this and edit, revise, and all that once I truly understand what I am doing and what the possibilities are.
So, I appreciate all the help and guidance.  So much information.  I know I am behind.  I know I've wasted time. But, I am trying.

"Try harder!"  

Oh don't you start with me now....
